🌱 A Little About Me
I’m just starting my journey in the world of front-end development, and I’m loving every step of it. Right now, I’m learning the basics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My dream? To build beautiful, functional websites for small businesses and eventually work as a freelance developer.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:

🐕 Hanging out with my dog (we’re working through his separation anxiety together).
🏃‍♀️ Trying to go for a run with my furry buddy to clear my mind and tire him (tired dog = good boy).
👗 Obsessing over fashion and shopping (my wardrobe is already huge, but there's always room for "just one more piece").
🌟 Why I’m Here
I love the idea of creating something tangible with code—something people can see and use. I’m especially drawn to front-end development because it combines creativity and problem-solving, two things I thrive on. I’m still learning, but I’m eager to build cool stuff and grow my skills.

🎯 Goals
Become a confident front-end developer.
Build a portfolio of projects I’m proud of.
Transition into freelance work and help small businesses create amazing online experiences.
